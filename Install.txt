Copy the .iwi files into: ".../your iw4x directory/userraw/images"   if you dont have the images or userraw folders, just create them.

In-game: "Options-->Video-->Advanced Video-->SpecularMap: Yes" 



Important-ish Notes: -The "Specific [blank]" folders are there just incase you wanted the names of certain weapons/weapon parts/attachments .iwi's and didnt know the name of them,                          or if you want to easily edit specific ones yourself.
    
     -this Shiny Weapon Pack just replaces the base "shine" of most weapons/attachments so you can still select camos like red tiger, blue tiger, etc.,. and the shine will still           be there, Some guns might look good, some might look terrible, but whatever. it is what it is.
     
     -The (red to blue) pack, is a red to blue gradient. Not a red to blue animation.
     
     -To me the f2000 was the brightest in the light so I used it for Preview pictures.
