Copy the .iwi files into: ".../your iw4x directory/userraw/images"   if you dont have the images or userraw folders, just create them.

In-game: "Options-->Video-->Advanced Video-->SpecularMap: Yes" 



Note -The "Specific [blank]" folders are there just incase you wanted the names of certain weapons/weapon parts/attachments .iwi's and didnt know the name of them, or if you want         to easily edit them yourself, they are currently using bright blue pack.
    
     -this Shiny Weapon Pack just replaces the base "shine" of most weapons/attachments so you can still select camos like red tiger, blue tiger, etc.,. and the shine will still be there, Some guns might look good, some might look terrible, but whatever. it is what it is.
     
     -I thought the F2000 had the brightest shine so I used it for the preview pictures, other weapons might not be as bright.
